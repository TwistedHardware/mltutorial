    "TensorFlow is Google's framework for developing Machine Learning models and is has developed into the most popular machine learning library. Since 2011, Google Brain Team has been developing TensorFlow and was used internally until is was released as an open-source software in Nov, 2015. It comes packed with the wide range of tools from dataset management to a good selection of high-level algorithms and even ready made models. That's a lot to pack in one solution!\n",

    "The team that is working on developing TensorFlow are some of the most influencal researchers in machine learning. It also has a huge amount of contributors and commits for such a relativly new project on Github. You quickly realize that TensorFlow is getting more attention from people in the field than any other existing machine learning solution and will be the technology starndard for machine learning development.\n",

    "Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It uses data instead of code to produce logic. The goal is to perform tasks that we usually equate human level intelligence and in many cases exceeds human level of intelligence like what happened with Alpha Go and many other examples. You actually use machine learning all the time without realizing when you use Google, YouTube, Amazon and so many other services that reley on machine learning to give you a better experience.\n",

    " \n",
    " So to kick of this part I'll start with a few simple concepts:\n",
    " \n",
    " ## The real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$\n",
    " \n",
    " The real numbers include positive, nagative numbers and zero. They can be of arbitrary precesion meaning they can have any number of decimal points or even numbers with infinite precision. The set real is denoted in mathimatics as $\\mathbb{R}$. Examples of real numbers include:\n",

    "$$f(x) = x + 2x + 3x + 4x + 5x = \\sum_{n=1}^{5}nx$$\n",
