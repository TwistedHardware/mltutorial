    "Before we go into tensors and programming in TensorFlow, let's take a look at how does it work.\n",
    "\n",
    "# TensorFlow Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow has a few concepts that you should be familiar with. TensorFlow executes your code inside a execution engine that you communicate with using an API. In TensorFlow your data is called a `Tensor` that you can apply operations (`OP`) to. Your code is converted into a `Graph` that is executed in an execution engine called a `Session`. So your python code is just a representation of your graph that can be executed in a session.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/graph.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see how your data (or tensors) flow from one operation to the next, hens the name TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since version 1.5 and as of version 1.8 there are two methods to execute code in TensorFlow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Graph Execution\n",
    "- Eager Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference is in graph execution is a type of `declarative programming` and eager execution is a type of `imperative programming`. In plain English, the difference is graph execution defines your code as a graph and executes in a session. Your objects in python are not the actual objects inside the session, they are only a reference to them. Eager execution executes your code as you run it giving you a better control of your program while it is running so you are not stuck with a predefined graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "## So why do we even bother with graph execution?\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance is a big issue in machine learning and a small difference in execution time can save you in a long project weeks of your time and 1000s of hours of GPU time. Support is another issue for now where some features of TensorFlow do not work in Eager Execution like high level estimators.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus in the following tutorials only on graph execution and we will cover eager execution later in this series.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors can be though of a scalar variable or an array of any dimension. Tensors are the main object to store pass data, sore variables and constants and all operations that take in data take it in tensor format and all operations that output data uses the tensor format for that too.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tensor Shape and Rank\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors have a rank and a shape so for scalar values, we use rank-0 tensors of a shape `()` which is an empty shape\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming we need a variable or a constant number to use in our software, we can represent it as a tensor of rank-0.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/rank-0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A rank-1 tensor can be though of as an __vector__ or a one dimensional array. To create a rank-1 tensor with shape `(3)` this will create a tensor that can hold three values in a single dimensional array.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/rank-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A rank-2 is a __matrix__ or a two dimensional array. This can be used to hold two dimensional data like a black and white image. The shape of the tensor can match the shape of the image so to hold a 256x256 pixel image in a tensor, you can create a rank-2 tensor of shape `(256,256)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/rank-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A rank-3 tensor is a three dimensional array. To can be used to hold three dimensional data like a color image represented in (RGB). To create a tensor to hold an color image of size 256x256, you can create a rank-3 tensor of shape `(256,256,3)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/rank-3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow allows tensors in higher dimensions but you will very rarely see tensors of a rank exceeding 5 of shape `(batch size, width, height, RGB, frames)` for representing a batch of video clips.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing Tensor Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's import TensorFlow and start working with some tensors."
